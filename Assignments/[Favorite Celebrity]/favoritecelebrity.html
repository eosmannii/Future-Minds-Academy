        <h2>Who was <u>Mathew Perry?</u></h2>
        <p>
          Matthew Perry began acting as a teenager. Following an early career
          marked by bit parts and failed pilots, Perry rocketed to fame in the
          mid-1990s with the Emmy-nominated role of Chandler Bing on the smash
          sitcom Friends. He went on to star in movies like Fools Rush In and
          The Whole Nine Yards. Off-screen, the actor struggled with addiction
          for many years. Perry later attempted to replicate his sitcom success
          with Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and Go On, eventually finding a
          ratings hit with a revival of The Odd Couple. Never married nor a
          father, he died at age 54 in October 2023.

        <h2>Childhood and Parents</h2>
        <p>
          Matthew Langford Perry was born on August 19, 1969, in Williamstown,
          Massachusetts. His actor father, John Bennett Perry, split up with his
          mother, Suzanne Langford, while Matthew was still an infant. He went
          to live with his mother in Ottawa, Canada. Suzanne served as press
          secretary to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Truedeau and later
          remarried. Matthews stepfather was Keith Morrison, a correspondent for
          NBCs Dateline program. Matthew attended Rockcliffe Park Public School
          and became friends with fellow student Justin Trudeau, the current
          prime minister of Canada. After moving to Los Angeles around the age
          of 15 to live with his father, Matthew enrolled at Buckley School. He
          graduated from the private school in 1987. Growing up, Matthew
          developed two passions: playing tennis and acting. “Giving up tennis
          wasnt really a decision I had to make,” he told Mens Health in 2012.
          “I was a very good tennis player in Ottawa, Canada—nationally ranked
          when I was, like, 13. Then I moved to Los Angeles when I was 15, and
          everyone in L.A. just killed me. I was pretty great in Canada. Not so
          much in Los Angeles.” Unlike his tennis prospects, a career in acting
          would be a different story. Early Roles Perry landed his first movie
          part while still in high school, a supporting role opposite star River
          Phoenix in A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon (1988). Unfortunately,
          the film came and went without much notice. In September 1987, Perry
          starred in his first sitcom, Second Chance. The show had a fantastical
          premise with Kiel Martin starring as a man who dies and gets a chance
          to go back to mentor a younger version of himself (played by Perry).
          The show was later retooled, dropping Martin and focusing on the
          teenage misadventures of Perrys character. Despite its new direction
          and new title, Boys Will Be Boys, the sitcom failed to attract enough
          of an audience to stay on the air. After the series ended, Perry
          landed a series of small parts and guest appearances on such programs
          as Empty Nest and Growing Pains. He also had a supporting role on the
          short-lived Valerie Bertinelli comedic vehicle Sydney in 1990. This
          same year, Perry gave a strong performance as Desi Arnaz Jr. in the
          television biopic Call Me Anna, about the life of actor Patty Duke.
          Three years later, Perry tried again for sitcom success with Home
          Free. He starred as a young reporter who lives at home with his
          mother, his sister, and her two kids. After a few months, the series
          was cancelled. Perry was then cast in the pilot for LAX 2194, a
          futuristic look at an airport which never aired.

        <h2>Friends fame</h2>
        <p>
          Perry soon found the perfect project with a leading role in a new
          sitcom about a group of young men and women in New York City. Debuting
          in September 1994, Friends became one of the most popular television
          sitcoms of all time. Perry played the witty and sarcastic Chandler
          Bing, who shared an apartment with an aspiring actor named Joey,
          played by Matt LeBlanc, and was a longtime friend of Ross, played by
          David Schwimmer. Completing the cast, Courteney Cox played Monica,
          Ross sister; Jennifer Aniston played Rachel, Monicas roommate; and
          Lisa Kudrow played Phoebe, the kooky, offbeat friend to all.
